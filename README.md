Temperature-Monitor
=====

This project was created as a means for me to learn more about other languages (namely C, Python, and maybe Objective-C) by applying it to something I can use in the real world.

#### Goals

- Create Linux Daemon to continuosly monitor temperature
- Create client application(s) to render information into a chart
- Create web front end to monitor results
